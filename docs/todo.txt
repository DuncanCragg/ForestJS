To Do
-----

 - --------------------
 - properly detect no diffs (to prevent looping)
 - don't add Notify for just UID string match (prevent mutual obs of objects in the first place)
 x store (ntf->rem) host/cache/remote uid in localStorage/config
 x save changes to shadow in eval loop, save to persistence, .then() make public and notify
 x only send remote Notify entries not local (prevent remote duplicating notifications back to you)
 x Timer===0 not a change
 - --------------------
 - React coupling
   - hardwiring from obj to notify react (o.react)
     - and from react to notify obj (o.userState)
   - React cpt refers to state and 'subscribes' to it (o.react.notify)
   - React cpt is actually the user object, which can observe a top object and anything linked under it
     - state('watching.counter') what if that changes?
     - state('giphy.url') instead of state('image') - but disappears, so no
     - state('image') relies on 'own' state subscribing and setting something for render
 - --------------------
 - more widgets: selector, radio, textarea..
 - --------------------
 - can have remote URL in any object
    - evaluate / animated remotely
    - remote only need Notify and render
    - wrap remote with Forest, like WebObjects did?
    - send userState over the wire
 - fetch:
    - check actually fetch()ing a URL!; lastmod/etag?
    - error on fetch
    - timeout? don't use fetch!
 - refresh? after viewed and time rel to cache ttl
    - only look through giphy (url) if button pressed, but then need to look through when it comes in and notify/evaluates.. ?
    - fetching on every view through url in path means you only don't notify when remote object is not changed
      .. and giphy always changes, so you get stuck in a loop
    - giphy: opaque URLs; non-idempotency
 - --------------------
 - deletions: set to undefined and they're removed
 - --------------------
 - any other way to pass thread than setTimeout(1)? setTimeout(0)!!
   - need to queue up doEvaluates, not use setTimeout?
   - only call doEvaluate if not already signalled
 - --------------------


 - --------------------
 - move numactive, numcompleted, shownTodos logic into evaluate (render is just show/hide/iterate no logic)
