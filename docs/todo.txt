To Do
-----

- render is too tightly coupled here, as a react class
   - extract the children, which are too coupled to React - I swap the children for react ones.. :-/
   - make it a list of UIDs and work out react render of children from object graph
   - can have remote URL in renderTree, without evaluate of course (Notify/render): send user-state over the wire

- autogenerate UIDs

- more widgets: selector, textarea, radio, checkbox.. move to another file
   - separate out gui widgets from 'this'

- fetch remote objects:
   - refresh? after viewed and time rel to cache ttl
   - check actually fetch()ing a URL!; lastmod/etag?
   - error on fetch
   - timeout? don't use fetch!
- wrap remote with Forest, like WebObjects did?
   - remote only need Notify and render
- only look through giphy (url) if button pressed, but then need to look through when it comes in and notify/evaluates.. ?
   - every view-through fetches means only don't notify when it's not changed .. and giphy always changes so get stuck in loop
   - giphy: opaque URLs; non-idempotency
- ensureObjectState if(Forest.objects[uid]) add observer to Notify!

- empty state first, so deletions can be picked up

- any other way to pass thread than setTimeout(1)? setTimeout(0)!!

- isomorphism

- React cpt refers to state and 'subscribes' to it, but what about 'watching.counter'? what if that changes?
   - .. and giphy.url instead of image.. relies on 'own' state subscribing and setting something for render
   - state.counter -> state('counter') again, which is more consistent with gui.widget('counter'..)
